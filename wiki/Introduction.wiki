Moopz is a MIDI Looper project.

= Introduction =

Moopz is based on Arduino platform and includes a MIDI Shield and LCD screen.
The looper analyzes MIDI protocol, detects loops and plays them automatically.

The project is still under early development stages and many features are still missing !

= Details =

== Auto Mode ==
In automatic mode, the looper will automatically decide to replay the recorded loop when the second note of the recorded loop is found.

*Example :*
You loop is A B C D A B C D A B C D  ...
The looper, set in "Record mode" will start to play at : "A B C D A B", and then play "C"



== Manual Mode ==
If you play a more complex melody, automatic mode will sometime fail.

*Example :*
You loop is A B C A B D A B C A B D A B C A B D ...
In automatic mode, the looper would start after the second "B", missing the "D" note.


In manual mode, the looper displays a message once a loop has been found and waits for a button press.
The looper will always remain the biggest loop found.

== Incoming features  ==
  * Improve loops detection (support of chords detection)
  * Detect BPM
  * Multi sample mode (a knob is used to select a Loop-Slot)
