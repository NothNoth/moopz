**Moopz** is a MIDI Looper program for Arduino platforms.

The program automatically detects loops on MIDI IN and plays them on MIDI out.
You can switch between Automatic Mode, Manual Mode (ack loops manually), etc.

_The projet is still under development and will be released soon for a first beta version !_
